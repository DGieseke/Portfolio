# Daniel Gieseke | Data Science Portfolio
Thanks for visiting my data science portfolio.  This portfolio is composed of several data-focused projects showcasing my skills in analytics, Python, SQL, and other data-oriented abilities. These projects are presented in the form of GitHub repositories, which link to the Jupyter Notebooks used to create my projects.  Below are quick links to these projects, and further down are quick synopses and visualizations of these projects.
